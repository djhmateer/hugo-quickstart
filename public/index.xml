      <description>Kit I found an excellent YouTube Video - making beer from kits by the guys at brewuk.co.uk.
I ended up buying the same kit from https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/ because they had faster customer service (brewuk didn&amp;rsquo;t respond to an initial email)

Starter Kit: Woodfordes Wherry Microbrewery from the-home-brew-shop for £72 and 10 extra CO2 bottles for an extra £5.
This is one of the most popular starting kits which is a classic bitter of around 4-5%</description>
