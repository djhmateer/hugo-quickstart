Going for 2.8CO2 vol, so 150g of sugar.

17th July - not ready yet. not enough CO2 even though high temperatures outside (26+ degree days)

## Bottle burst

25th October - noticed that one of the bottles has exploded. Maybe it was a crate on top of it. Had been in a hot summer house all summer. Other bottles have been fine.

Also the beer wasn't as carbonated as should have been, and had lost something.
