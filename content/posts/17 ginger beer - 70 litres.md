This is my most popular brew, followed by the lagers that I've made.

I had some major issues with massive carbonation last night and glass bottles exploding outside. It seemed like in the warmer weather, some redidual ginger kept on making sugars, which were fermenting. Even though I'd fermented the original brew for over 6 weeks.

This time I'm going to use more yeast so hopefully get a faster full fermentation.

Not sure what I'm going to do with the bottles/storage.

But I'm keeping a similar recipe and it is lovely. Essentially the same as the link, but with half portions of ginger


I have 1420g of ginger

100g of ginger gives me 5litres.
so I have enough ginger for 71 litres of ginger beer. wow. I do have enough fermenter space I think!


Simmer for 15mins

Suger needed is 
400g per 5 litres for 5% brew
so for 70 litres I need 5.6Kg of sugar

Lemons needed
4 lemons for 5 litres
  56 lemons
  1 lemon is 30ml

1.7 litres of lemon juice
 + some more limes

Cool to room temp and SG is: 1045ish

50 litres in the mash ton, 21 more litres spread over the 2 buckets.

## Yeast

I used 2 packets in each fermenter to try and get a faster fermentation happening.
