Second runnings after we noticed the some good colour in what was coming out after the sparge! Lewes Home Brew club brew day at Pepperpot Brewery

I boiled what I had and got 17.5 litres. At 1060 which is more than I thought it would be.


IPA inspired by Tree House hazy IPA.

I like Northern Monk - Faith. Which is a similar style of beer.



## Boil

Boiled for 1 hour.

Did hop additions.

## Cool and Ferment

I didn't use my chiller, so it took overnight to cool enough to pitch.

I then found my fermenter had a leak. So had to transfer to another one (introducing O2)

29th Oct pitched.

## Dry Hop

I dry hopped on day 6 and on day 11 it is still fermenting. 5 days of dry hopping so far.

Kegged on day 11 as 5 days dry hopping is plenty. Tasted it whilst transferring and it is lovely.
