## Water Profile

I've not got a pH test

Got KH value of 10.9 (very hard - which feels right) from my [salifert]() test kit

[https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water.html](https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water.html) - but couldn't understand

[baseline treatment 2018](https://homebrewbeer.netlify.app/2022/11/14/water-treatment/)

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre. so 4ml for 20 litres (pauls spreadsheet said more but I had bad results)
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 10g for 20 litre batch.  From paul's spreadsheet IPA style

My [Semlos](https://us.amazon.com/Semlos-Digital-Meter-Quality-Tester/dp/B075K64M8Z) digital pH meter gave me a reading of 5.2 after additions which is great. But not to be believed.

It did show original tap pH of 7.2 whereas tap in Lewes was 6.8.
