## Water Profile

I've not got a pH test

Got KH value of 10.9 (very hard - which feels right) from my [Salifert type kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001EJ3DOG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 

[https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water.html](https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water.html) - but couldn't understand

[baseline treatment 2018](https://homebrewbeer.netlify.app/2022/11/14/water-treatment/)

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre. so 4ml for 20 litres (pauls spreadsheet said more but I had bad results)
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 10g for 20 litre batch.  From paul's spreadsheet IPA style

My [Semlos](https://us.amazon.com/Semlos-Digital-Meter-Quality-Tester/dp/B075K64M8Z) digital pH meter gave me a reading of 5.2 after additions which is great. But not to be believed.

It did show original tap pH of 7.2 whereas tap in Lewes was 6.8.


## Recipe

- mash at 68 for 60mins
- mashout at 78 for 10 mins 

## Ferment

OG was 1042

Great day to brew in SE England in November (no ice to free the hose pipe)

Apparently these cheap pH meters are worthless! Got a reading on 5.1 (and Brewfather calculator gave me an estimate of 5.5 so in the same ballpark)

Hop bag going in on day 3 so have a magnet in this bag and one on the top of the fermenter.

First time using this technique

cooler connector is always popping off - threads don't do up properly. Need to fix.

## Condition

9 days fermenting (1st Dec in Keg). 1012 FG. Smelled lovely.


## Next Time

try and fix connector

get campden tablets
