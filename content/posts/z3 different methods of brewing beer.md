- 1. Mashing. 

Mill (Crush) the grains - barley, rye, wheat and others. Cracking the husks of each individual kernel to allow the water a chance to get at the soluble starches. ..these starches would be used to by the seed to provide a food source for the growing plant... brewers are after the sugars to feed something of their own.. yeast.

After milling. need to let them steep in a brew bag inside a massive pot. This extracts the sugars. Then take the grain out, and bin it. And boil the water. This is now wort.

Malt is dry malted barley, rye, wheat or other grains mixed with warm water ('liquor' to brewers) to produce a glutinous (sticky / gloopy or gluey) substance. Is this Malt Extract (above?)

This sweet, starchy liquid, is known as wort
