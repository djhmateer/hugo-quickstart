These are the different methods of home brewing beer 

[https://www.brewuk.co.uk/beer](https://www.brewuk.co.uk/beer)

- 1. Starter kit

[mangrove jacks craft series 40 pints juicy session ipa](https://brew2bottle.co.uk/products/mangrove-jacks-craft-series-40-pints-juicy-session-ipa) £19.95  which you need to add 1.2kg [Pure Malt Enchancer](https://brew2bottle.co.uk/products/mangrove-jacks-1-2kg-pure-malt-enhancer?variant=16698333134963) £4.95


- 2. Malt Extract
Is concentrated wort. LME - Liquid Malt Extract. DME Dry malt extract. 

Extract brewing is adding water to malt extract and boiling (usually for 60 minutes). Wort is the final product before adding the yeast to ferment.

Some malt extracts are pre-hopped. Recommend buying hop pellets and doing yourself.

- 2. BIAB Brew in a Bag

Easy approach to All Grain Brewing

I have an 8litre cooking pot - looks like I need about a 20l pot.. ideallly 30 or 40l pot

Also called a brew kettle. Big stock pot. Avoid wide.

- 3. All grain - full mash

Maybe need a 3 vessel system to do this?

Interestingly people seem to go from 5 gallons (40 pints) to 10 gallon batches.

- 1. Mashing. 

Mill (Crush) the grains - barley, rye, wheat and others. Cracking the husks of each individual kernel to allow the water a chance to get at the soluble starches. ..these starches would be used to by the seed to provide a food source for the growing plant... brewers are after the sugars to feed something of their own.. yeast.

After milling. need to let them steep in a brew bag inside a massive pot. This extracts the sugars. Then take the grain out, and bin it. And boil the water. This sweet starchy liquid is now wort.

The enzymes in the base malt convert starches into sugars. These sugars will give us alcohol


strike water (from tap) - maybe we need cambden tablets (potassium metabisulphate)

kettle - vessel - stock pot.. ideally  5.5 gallons 25 litres which makes 3 gallons of beer (ahh we want to make 5 gallons of beer - 40 pints, so we need maybe 50l which is 11 gallons). Can buy a new pot for £66. [themlatmiller.co.uk](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product-category/equipment/stainless-steel-pots/) 

mash ton - the vessel with a sieve in the bottom

vorlauf aka recirculation - filtering out the first 0.5 gallon of the wort
 keep doing until you see no more grains

spurge - rinse grains with hot water to get as much sugar as possible


### Stock pot

[https://www.cooksmill.co.uk/kitchen/catering-cookware/aluminium-cookware/709-medium-duty/709-series-medium-duty-stockpot-and-lid-50-ltr-40cm-diameter.html](https://www.cooksmill.co.uk/kitchen/catering-cookware/aluminium-cookware/709-medium-duty/709-series-medium-duty-stockpot-and-lid-50-ltr-40cm-diameter.html) £84 including VAT (in stock)

mesh bag - big enough to line kettle

thermometer

immersion wort chiller (copper pipe)

cambden tablets to get rid of chroline?

gist - granis?

grain + hot water (maybe around 72) = the mash.. doesn't have to be the full amount
  really need to stir up well...2 to 5 mins.. no dough balls

wort - hot liquid that is soon to be beer!
grain + hot water + time (1 hour).. probably around 66 want..drops to around 60...give a stir at half way  = wort
   during the rest period enzymes
   good time to sanitize

mash out (optional) - slight heat

sparge water - cold (treated).. put the bag in here if not doing full amount

lautering (draining) = separating grain from. wort (just lifting if BIAB - the grist is what is inside the bag)). Probably about 4 gallons now.

BIAB - mashing and boiling in the same vessel
 ie no using a dedicated mash tun with a false bottom (screen)

 full volume mash - ie starting with the same amount of water as we want to end up with
    aprox 5.5 gallons to yield 3.5 gallons after the boil (allowing for losses with evaporation and absorbtion in the grain)

- 2. Boiling

Wort is heated to a rolling boil. Enzymes that were breaking down teh starches are stepped, giving a known quantity of sugars. 

Hops are added into the brew in batches. Hundreds of different kids of hops available. The longer the hop is in the boil, the more a hops adds. So lots of added here will give a bitterness to the beer. Those introduced later on in the boil give more delicate armoas.

maybe add finings?

probably boil for 60 minutes

- 3. Fermentation

then cool down with cooler... or put the pot in the bath or sink full of cold water.

This is important to avoid infetion? try in less than 45mins

Good to have a lot of ice ready for this.


Wort is cooled. Temp needs to come down quickly when done - big copper coil?

put into the fermenter (the bucket?)


Yeast is 'pitched'. Yeast consumes the sugars. Beer foams. Yeasts take the sugars and converts into ethanol and CO2. Hundreds of different yeast strains.

This can take about 7 days? keep out of the light?


- 4. Conditioning

It is now beer!
Several days to weeks. If have barrels can be months or years. 

Maturation stage lets the remaining yeast reabsorb...
