## Mash

I'm using Brew in a Bag:

[![pot](/images/2021-10-25/pot.jpg "pot")](/images/2021-10-25/pot.jpg)

I started with about 28 litres of water (Strike Water)

Strike Temperature (ie before grains) 72C

Mash Temp 66C (had to let it cool for a few minutes as was just under 68 when I measured)

1 hour in the mash. 

[![pot](/images/2021-10-25/drain.jpg "pot")](/images/2021-10-25/drain.jpg)

Using a tree swing to help gert the rest of the wort out.

## Boil

25g Boadicea at 60min, 15mins then the rest at flameout.

Leave to cool overnight

- Outside temp at 0935 is: 12.4
- Wort temp is: 20.6
- OG is: 1040
- Final amount: 24litres. Was aiming for 23litres

## Ferment

Pitched yeast at 0950 on Tue 26th Oct.

2.5 weeks until transferred to pressure keg.

##

Learned not to fill a full keg with CO2. I messed up with the wrong top so can no naturally produced CO2 in my keg.

The keg visibly expanded when I put the CO2 cannister in it!

Drinking some of it then pressurising is good.

Beer is tasting good.
