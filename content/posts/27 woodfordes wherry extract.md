For a local brewing event I'm revisiting the first beer I ever made - [Woodfordes Wherry](https://www.woodfordes.com/beers/wherry/) which is a malt extract kit. I found the best place to buy in 2022 at [the-home-brew-shop.co.uk](https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/woodfordes-wherry-beer-kit.html)

Follow the instructions on the packet - make the cans warm so will pour. Put into a fermenter with boiling water, mix, top up to 23 litres with cold. Add the yeast. Nice!
