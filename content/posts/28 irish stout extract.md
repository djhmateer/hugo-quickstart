Bought this for fun to see what it is like and to demo to the CASK Beer event.


ABV Approx: 4.9%

Bitterness: 4/5

IBU: 40-50

Colour: Black

Makes: 23 L

Yeast: M42 New World Strong Ale

Dry Hops: Galena


I find some kits to be quite thin, so I'm going to make 19l instead of 23l

1056 sg

## Ferment

1st Feb it was still at 1032, and bubbling away slowly. Temps have been colder than I would like. From 19 to 13 degrees, hence slow fermentation.

Dry hop once gets to around 1020

9th Feb it is 1016, so dry hop

## Keg

26th March put into a keg and force carbed at 30psi for a few hours (rolled around too). Very drinkable beer!
