[Tropical IPA Extract](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/muntons-tap-room-tropical-ipa-1-5kg/)

For £19 this makes 17.6 litres of IPA at 5.5%

1kg of spraymalt or [brewing sugar](https://www.home-brew-online.com/brewing-sugar-1kg/) is required. I'm going to use 500g normal table sugar and 500g Spray Malt which is a Dried Malt Extract. DME cost - £5. Sugar cost around?
