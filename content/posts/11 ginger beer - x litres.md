Sun 13th March 22 started this

I have 662g of ginger

I used half portions compared to recipe

I used 200g for 10litres
so 100g for 5 litres

I will brew 25 litres so need 500g ginger

650g of ginger will give me 32.5 litres.
so lets go with 33 litres of ginger beer

4 lemons 
70ml lime juice
70ml lemon

1 lemon is 30ml

Need equivalent of 26 lemons - 500ml

Simmer for 15mins


400g sugar for 5l for 5% brew
600g sugar for 5l for 7.5% brew

I'm going to go for 500g for 5l for probably 6.2% as it has been so good before, but going slightly lower to make more sessionable.

so 100g for 1litre of 6.2%

so need 3.25Kg of sugar

Cool to room temp and SG is: 1045ish

I only got 28 litres (as guessed the amount of water to add). Strange that SG looked about right.
