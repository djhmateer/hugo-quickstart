> Basically get rid of any chlorine, make sure your mash pH hits around 5.2 and your pretty much home and dry.

Use a [Salifert type kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001EJ3DOG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Intro

What is water treatment for beer?

[How to Brew](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Brew-Everything-Great-Every/dp/1938469356) says that firstly you need to consider:

- Sanitisation
- Fermentation temperature control
- Yeast management
- The boil - can undercook and overcook
- The recipe - right proportion of ingredients to provide complexity and balance of flavours

And then consider water treatment. So lets not dwell too deeply!

## Baseline

With my full report on https://www.southernwater.co.uk/media/6538/zs536.pdf (not working now)

- 247 CaCO3mg/l (hard)
- 6.8 pH (13th Nov 22 in Lewes)

## Baseline 2018 - Murphys

This is from Paul and the recommendations:

## Baseline 2024

- Mg  2.9	
- Ca - 97.5
- Cl - 40.8	
- SO4 - 22.2	
- HCO3 - 257.0


## Additions Nov 2024

Campden tablets (Sodium Metabisulphite) - remove chlorine and chloramine from tap water. 0.5 tablet in 30 litres is fine.

Protafloc (Irish Moss). Use in last 15mins of boil to produce clear wort. For most brews (not NEIPA's!)


### Bitters IPAs and Pales
todo.

### Stouts

More suited to the hard water I have (and Dublin and London)

## Lagers and Pilsners

Soft water (like Pilsen)


### Salts / ions / dissolved minerals

- Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)
- Magnesium Sulphate/Epsom Salt (MgSO4)
- Sodium Chloride/Canning Salt/Table Salt (NaCl)
- Calcium Sulfate / Gypsum (CaSO4)

## ChatGPT

These salts are typically added as dissolved minerals, contributing specific ions to the brewing water. Each salt dissociates into ions when it dissolves, affecting the beer's flavor, clarity, and chemistry.

Here’s a breakdown:

**Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂):** Dissociates into calcium (Ca²⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻) ions.
   - **Calcium** helps with yeast health and clarity.
   - **Chloride** enhances mouthfeel and sweetness.

**Magnesium Sulfate / Epsom Salt (MgSO₄):** Dissociates into magnesium (Mg²⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions.
   - **Magnesium** is needed in small amounts for yeast health.
   - **Sulfate** accentuates hop bitterness and adds crispness.

**Sodium Chloride / Canning Salt / Table Salt (NaCl):** Dissociates into sodium (Na⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻) ions.
   - **Sodium** adds a subtle fullness to the flavor (used sparingly).
   - **Chloride** contributes to mouthfeel and sweetness.

**Calcium Sulfate / Gypsum (CaSO₄):** Dissociates into calcium (Ca²⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions.
   - **Calcium** aids in mash stability and enzyme activity.
   - **Sulfate** can emphasize hop bitterness.

Adjusting these salts in your brewing water allows you to achieve the desired flavor balance in your beer.


### pH 

0 pH is most acidic. baking soda is alkaline at pH 9.

suitable pH for mashing is 5.4

- Lactic Acid 
- AMS (CRS) - Acid Malt Solution - Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). 
      and Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)
- Citric Acid - just for a fruity flavour

ascorbic acid in NEIPAs when bottling to minimize oxidation 0.2g?

## Additions OLD

For pale ales I'm going with:

AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres [Malt Miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/ams-crs-500ml/) **this is very wrong**

DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash [Malt Miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dwb-500g/) **this is very wrong**


For Stouts lower on the AMS - (see Pauls spreadsheet.)

## Campden Tablets

[https://blog.homebrewing.org/using-campden-tablets-homebrewing/](https://blog.homebrewing.org/using-campden-tablets-homebrewing/)

I'm unsure if I'll use a campden tablet as shouldn't need if I get sanitising done well. Maybe for the chrlorine.

Not be be confused with Protofloc tablets (Irish moss) which is used to clear the beer.
