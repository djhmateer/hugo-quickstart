What is water treatment for beer?

[How to Brew](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Brew-Everything-Great-Every/dp/1938469356) says that firstly you need to consider:

- Sanitisation
- Fermentation temperature control
- Yeast management
- The boil - can undercook and overcook
- The recipe - right proportion of ingredients to provide complexity and balance of flavours

And then consider water treatment. So lets not dwell too deeply!

## Additions

For pale ales I'm going with:

AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres [Malt miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/ams-crs-500ml/)


DWB: 10g for 20litres in the mash [Malt Miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dwb-500g/)


[The Homebrew Challenge - American Pale Ale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqdRKKyzRtY) - epsom salt, gypsom, calcium chloride and lactic acid 

For Stouts lower on the AMS - (see Pauls spreadsheet.)
