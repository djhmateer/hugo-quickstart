What is water treatment for beer?

[How to Brew](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Brew-Everything-Great-Every/dp/1938469356) says that firstly you need to consider:

- Sanitisation
- Fermentation temperature control
- Yeast management
- The boil - can undercook and overcook
- The recipe - right proportion of ingredients to provide complexity and balance of flavours

And then consider water treatment. So lets not dwell too deeply!

## Baseline

[https://www.southernwater.co.uk/how-hard-is-your-water](https://www.southernwater.co.uk/how-hard-is-your-water)

With my full report on https://www.southernwater.co.uk/media/6538/zs536.pdf

- 247 CaCO3mg/l (hard)
- 6.8 pH (13th Nov 22 in Lewes)

## Additions

For pale ales I'm going with:

AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres [Malt Miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/ams-crs-500ml/) **this is very wrong**

DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash [Malt Miller](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dwb-500g/) **this is very wrong**


For Stouts lower on the AMS - (see Pauls spreadsheet.)

## Campden Tablets

I'm unsure if I'll use a campden tablet as shouldn't need if I get sanitising done well. Maybe for the chrlorine.


Not be be confused with Protofloc tablets (Irish moss) which is used to clear the beer.
