<!-- [https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party. -->

## Setup

19 litres of water in grainfather

## Water treatment

No water treatment as am still testing my brew systems for off flavours

## Mash

- Mild ale malt 3kg 
- Dark crystal malt 0.5kg

## Boil

- 1 hour (did for 1:15) started at 27 litres and ended at 22 litres and got 20 litres in fermenter (aiming for 23 litres of wort).. added 2.5 litres of water

## Cool and ferment

yeast is Lalbrew Verdant IPA [info](https://beermaverick.com/yeast/lallemand-lalbrew-verdant-ipa/) 

pitch at low end eg 18-19 degrees. Fermenting at room temp


## Keg and Condition

After 1 month. Keg at 45psi for 1 day.

## Drink

Lovely beer that isn't too strong. Very sessionable. Getting good around 5 - 6 weeks.


## next time
