## Water Profile

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre.  (this tallies with longman who did equivalent of 3.3ml) so 4ml for 20 litres
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 2g per 10litres. so 2.1g (as longman went higher). so 4g

## Recipe

Am doing a split batch of 2 * 10 litres to test out hop additions

Second runnings after we noticed the some good colour in what was coming out after the sparge! Lewes Home Brew club brew day at Pepperpot Brewery

I boiled what I had and got 17.5 litres. At 1060 which is more than I thought it would be.


IPA inspired by Tree House hazy IPA.

I like Northern Monk - Faith. Which is a similar style of beer.



## Boil

Boiled for 1 hour.

Did hop additions.

## Cool and Ferment

I didn't use my chiller, so it took overnight to cool enough to pitch.

I then found my fermenter had a leak. So had to transfer to another one (introducing O2)

29th Oct pitched.

## Dry Hop

I dry hopped on day 6
