## Mash

I'm doing a double batch

2 * 19 litres = 38 litres

I've got a 50 litre pot (to the brim)

23+15 = 38 litres of strike water. I'm going to have to sparge.

36 litres would have been better, then top up after done all stirring to get rid of clumps.

My bigger bag is much better than smaller one I had before.

[Mash Paddle](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/mash-paddle/) brilliant too


Strike temp: 66 degrees

As last calcs were wrong, I'm going for about 68 and will heat back up if needed.. temp dropped a lot to out 57. Heated back up to 66.
