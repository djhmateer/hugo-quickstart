<!-- [https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party. -->

Page 119 from the [Huhes Home Brew Beer Book]() - this is an easy drinking beer for a party in about 5 weeks.

## Setup

Doing BIAB

## Water treatment

No water treatment as am still testing my brew systems for off flavours

## Mash

- Pale ale 6.5kg
- Carapils 0.1kg
- Unknonwn malt 0.3kg

- Temp - 65C 
- Time - 1 hour  (started at 1210)


## Protein Rest

at 72 degrees for 20 mins. To aid in head retention, fuller body, and higher efficiency

## Boil

started at 1410

- Northdown (7.2%) 40g (should have been 50g of EKG which is a 5.5% alpha) and I'm brewing a slightly bigger batch
- Northdown 15g at 15mins
- Northdown 15g at 5min
- Northdown 9g at turn off
- Bramling cross 23g at turn off


## Cool and ferment

OG should have been 1050

I got 1020 (or so I thought)

added 800g of sugar... then *stirred* and I've got 1058 now. A bit higher than expected.

I found another small fermenter, so gravity should be around 1050 now.

pitched at 31 degrees, and fermenting at room temp (garage)

Should have been Wyeast 1056 american ale. I've used Kveik.

## Keg

1 month of fermenting on 5th September. FG was 1002 or 1004. Wow the Kveik attenuates really highly.

Also put some in bottles.

Keg at 45psi to carbonate in 24 hours.

Quite sweet... and strong!

6 weeks later and all finished. Really got better around 5 - 6 weeks.
