A pale ale is a great starter all grain beer. Ferment at room temperature (for me), conditions fairly quickly (as not strong). And is a crowd pleaser as it is sessionable.

## Strategy

- Sanitisation
- Fermentation temperature control
- Yeast management
- The boil - can undercook and overcook
- The recipe - right proportion of ingredients to provide complexity and balance of flavours

Get right amount of liquor

Find my effeciency

## Water treatment
AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres

DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash 

[Water]() blog post

## Mash
I'm using 29 litres of Strike Water From page 312 of [How to Brew]() 

So will get 27 litres to the boil

Then 23 litres to the fermenter

Heat up water took about 40 minutes

- Extra Pale Malt 4.3kg (actually did 4.48kg as brew effeciency)
- Light crystal malt 95g

Temp - 65C (put in at 66 as cold day, with a jacket on the kettle)
Time - 1 hour (10:05 started)


## Boil

1135 boil started

- 35g challenger added at start
- 23g East Kent Golding at flame out
- 16g Styrian Goding at flame out

1 Protafloc tablet (3g) at flame out (should have been at 15mins)

## Ferment 

Have a new cooler, and took about 1 hour to get to 20 degrees.

I strained out all the liquid using my BIAB (25 litres)

FG at 20 degrees was: 1042

- WLP005 British Ale Yeast pitched

Keeping at around 18 degrees.

Friday 25th Nov I did the mash. Now on Tue 6th Dec. 11 days in the fermenter. Temp now at 15 degrees (day).

Using new refractomemter, I'm getting a reading of 4% brix, which is 1014 at 18 degrees

New hydrometer is giving 1012 which means it is done fermenting.

## Kegging

First time I've used a keg for beer.

## Force Carb

19th Dec (been sitting in a keg for 13 days under no real pressure) put under pressure.

Disconnect check valve

Grey = gas


[![pot](/images/2022-11-22/6.jpg "recipe")](/images/2022-11-22/6.jpg)

I have a gas leak on my gas line somewhere. 


It is quite warm outside (13 degrees, 12 at night)





## Efficiencies

## Next with Danstar Nottingham 
P34 of Hughes book suggest this

## Next with S33
Next brew I'll do the same with SafAle S33 instead of WLP005. S33 is much cheaper.

 WLP005 to SafAle S33

## Next more of an American PA (APA)
