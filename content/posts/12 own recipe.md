[Brewfather.app](https://brewfather.app/) is the software I'm trialling to help me make recipes and keep stock of ingredients.

[SMaSH](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/blog/smash-brewing/)

Maris Otter malt from [longman](https://www.longmanbrewery.com/)

[SafLager W-34/70](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fermentis-SafLager-Brewers-Sachets-Fermentation/dp/B08J1BRWZ4/ref=sr_1_5) for about Â£5 each. [more info on brewuk](https://www.brewuk.co.uk/safale-w-34-70-yeast.html) essentially a popular lager yeast.


## Recipes

[https://recipes.brewuk.co.uk/view-recipe/321](https://recipes.brewuk.co.uk/view-recipe/321) - includes some crystal. About 90g of hops. Vienna Lager.

[https://recipes.brewuk.co.uk/view-recipe/54](https://recipes.brewuk.co.uk/view-recipe/54) 75% Maris. 60g hops. Vienna Lager.

[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/rustic-german-lager-kellerpils/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/rustic-german-lager-kellerpils/) German lager. 28g hops (but needs more to hit IBU). 2 weeks ferment at 15. 5 weeks lager at 2.


## Mash

I've got a 30 litre fermenter bucket so lets max it out

34 litres of strike water

It takes me time to get everything setup, so I'm happy to brew as much as possible. Even if I have to throw it away.

Aim for 4.5% lager

4.7kg for 5% at 19litres hitting OG of 1051

4.5kg for 4.8% at 22litres hitting og of 1046, which is 204g per litre

I want 30litres so 6.1kg. Call it 6kg as I want less ABV.

Will aim for mash at 66 and 75mins.

My OG at ambient temp is: 1044 which is almost perfect as I wanted 1046 for 30 litres. Will see how much I've actually got.

## Boil

Hops - amercian lager only has 27g

Some others has 60, 15, 5... 94g with dry hop day 5

Some have 60g.. half at boil, half at flame out.
40g is delicate hop
30g too - half up front, half at flame out


boil time: 60

target - intense aroma
challenger - british ales and lagers
columbus - american ipa
first gold - my own crop. british. multiple uses


beginning of the boil for bitterness
end of boil for aroma

- 10 first gold at 60
- 15 first gold at 30
- 25 challenger at 0

## Ferment

Went into fermenter on the 25th of April. I pitched 2 packets of the W34/70 lager yeast. After a day or two it was bubbling very nicely. 6 days later and it is still fermenting well.

## Bottle and Keg

15th May bottle and put into keg. Just under 3 weeks in fermenter

[https://www.hopsteiner.com/co2-calculator/](https://www.hopsteiner.com/co2-calculator/) I am aiming high for carbonation of 3.2 CO2 volume.

So for 30litres, I need 265g of sugar.
