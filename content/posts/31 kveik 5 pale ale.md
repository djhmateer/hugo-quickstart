## Water treatment
None!

## Mash

- Extra Pale Malt 5Kg (was 4.3kg)
- Light crystal malt 150g (was 95g)

Temp - 65C 
Time - 1 hour 

## Sparge

Added about 8 litres or so.. Until have got about 27 litres (so will have 23 litres after boil). This didn't work - I only had 20 litres after boil and losses.

## Boil

- 45g (should be 35g) challenger added at start. 33g challenger and 13g celeia (as this is what I had)
- 30g (23g) East Kent Golding at flame out
- 25 (16g) Styrian Golding (am using Celeia which is an offspring) at flame out

1 Protafloc tablet (3g) at 15mins

1 hour boil

## Ferment 

OG at 20 degrees was: 1054 (but I added a 3 extra litres of water so will be less)

Aiming for 35 degrees. But am on around 23 degrees, and it started fermenting after 8 hours.

Next day it is bubbling away nicely (blow off tube into pint glass)

Struggling to get warmer than 23 (goal is 35). Ended up at 29degrees (next time don't cool so much after boil!)

Fermented out in 2.5 days!

Cold crash down to 5 degrees and added CO2 


## Condition and Drink

[![pot](/images/2023-06-06/2.jpg "treatment")](/images/2023-06-06/2.jpg)

Was drinking this tasty beer in 5 days

After 3 weeks it changed a lot .. conditioning has helped!

This is a delicious beer. The additional hops are good and the additional strength too. I'll probably dial it down a bit next time to make more sessionalble, but keep the hop content up.
