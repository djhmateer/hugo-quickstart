Fri 26th November started this

130g of ginger (instead of 200g) blended up with a bit of water.

5l water

5 small lemon skins

7 small lemons juiced

Simmer for 15mins

Took off

600g sugar (split 300 white and 300 brown) aiming for 7.5% ABV

Cool to room temp and SG is: 1.050

After 15 days it is still fermenting and SG is now: 1.008

[https://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/](https://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/) giving me 5.5%ABV

With some syrup added it is very nice, and very gingery/fiery.

## Bottling

I'm going for the strategy of 

- waiting until all fermentation is done (bubbles have stopped)

- sweeten with lactose

- dissolve 60g of sugar and bottle and leave somewhere warm for a week in bottles

This is safer that the adding sugar to sweeter, as I'm transporting the ginger beer 500 miles by car, and then over the period of 10 days across more temperatures. I don't want explosions!
