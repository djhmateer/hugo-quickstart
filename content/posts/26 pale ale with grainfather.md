## Water treatment
AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres (I added 20ml)
DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash 

## Mash
Only need 15.6 litres of water for the mash

(grain weight * 2.7) + 3.5

I added a few more litres to make it easier to stir the grain

Started at 0935. Air temp is -1 degrees. Water temp was 9 degrees.

- Extra Pale Malt 4.3kg
- Light crystal malt 95g

Temp - 65C 
Time - 1 hour (started at 1210)

## Sparge

Added about 8 litres or so.. 

## Boil

about 25 litres to begin with

- 35g challenger added at start
- 23g East Kent Golding at flame out
- 16g Styrian Goding at flame out

1 Protafloc tablet (3g) at 15mins

Did a 45 min boil as running out of time

x litres at end

## Ferment 

FG at 20 degrees was: 1048

- SAFAle S33 dried yeast 

Keeping at around 18 degrees.

Friday 25th Nov I did the mash. Now on Tue 6th Dec. 11 days in the fermenter. Temp now at 15 degrees (day).

Using new refractomemter, I'm getting a reading of 4% brix, which is 1014 at 18 degrees

New hydrometer is giving 1012 which means it is done fermenting.

## Next with Danstar Nottingham 
P34 of Hughes book suggest this

## Next with S33
Next brew I'll do the same with SafAle S33 instead of WLP005. S33 is much cheaper.
