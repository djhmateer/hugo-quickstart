This recipe is taken from the book Beer Craft by Jon Finch


## Mash

[https://biabcalculator.com/](https://biabcalculator.com/) 

Crisp Extra Pale Maris Otter (5000 grams)

Crisp Caramalt (300 grams)

Strike Water: 26.7 litres for a 19 litre batch size (only ended up with 17.5l)

I treated my water with 1/4 teaspoon of Sodium Metabisulphite (Campden)

Strike temp: 66C (strange result from website above). Ended up going for 69C

Mash temp: 65C ended up 66.5 so 66 was probably good above

Length: 60mins


## Mash Out

Out temp: 75

Out time: 10mins

## Boil

Time: 60mins

40g Centennial at 60mins
30g Centennial at 10mins
30g Amarillo at flame out. Steep for 30mins
30g Simcoe at flame out. Steep for 30mins

## Hoisting Brew Bag and Drain

Target Original Gravity: 1.066

After letting the wort cool to ambient I got:  1.055

Next time I'll squeeze the bag more and be careful to get all the wort out.

Put into fermenter on 1st Jan 2022.
