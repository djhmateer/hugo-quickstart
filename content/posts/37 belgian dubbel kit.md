<!-- [https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party. -->

Malt extract kit. [Belgian Dubbel](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/festival-world-beer-kits-belgian-dubbel/?v=79cba1185463) from malt miller.  Around Â£25.90

## Ferment

room temperature

## Keg

It still is fermenting 1 month later.

Very tasty beer (and strong) a bit cloudy.

This beer needs more time to condition for sure.
