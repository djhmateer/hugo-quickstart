<!-- [https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party. -->

## Water treatment

No water treatment as am still testing my brew systems for off flavours

## Mash

Started water heating at 0610

- Extra pale malt 
- Vienna Malt 
- Flaked Oats including husk
- Carapils
- CaraGold Malt 

5.36kg total grain bill

- Temp - 67
- Time - should be 60 mins (started at 0655). Did 40 mins.

Was hard to stir all those oat husks

Protein Rest - am only dong this for clearer beers like lagers.

## Boil

0740 started heating to boil from 67

Want to start with 26 litres as want to end with 24l then 23 in fermenter?

0810 boiling (added 4 litres of hot water)

- Magnum 6g at 60 min
- No Protofloc - usually at 15mins.
- Simcoe 20g at 0 min
- Centennial 20g at 0 min

## Cool and ferment

OG should be 1045 - have got 1030 at around 23 litres in the fermenter (which is good). Am going to try stirring in the mash. Added about 500g of sugar. Probably 1040.

Yeast: Verdant IPA Yeast

Using SS Bretech silver fermenter.

Ferment at 18c degrees
then diacetyl rest at 22c

## Dry Hop

Typically day 4 or 5. I'm doing day 6 - Mon 9th Oct.

- dry hop Simcoe 80g
- dry hop Centennial 40g

3 day cold crash at end of fermentation (actually did 16 day cold crash)

be really careful to filter or not get detrius into keg

## Keg

Kegged on 8th Nov, and put in around 20 psi of CO2

12th Dec - a bit over carbed for me, so leaving at lower pressure for a while.


## Next time

Sanitise grainfather before starting - it was thoroughly cleaned.

dry hop get ready with a magnet to drop after 4 or 5 days so don't have to open ferenter.
