This is a 4.5% Heineken clone and I'm making 30 litres (was 23 litres)..which is the upper limit of the packet of s-189 yeast. multiplication factor of 1.3.

## Mash

malt per litre = 4.65/23 = 0.2kg/litre
carahell per litre = 0.12/23 = 0.005kg/litre

- Lager malt - 6.1kg
- Carahell malt - 0.16kg
- Temp - 66
- Time - 45 mins with stirring at start and middle

Next time don't use grate on top as meant I couldn't stir in the middle and got in the way.

Also don't take off pipe on top as accidentally put on pump which could have caused injury.

Next time use my sparge water boiler to speed up!

## Boil

1 hour

- Northern Brewer 16g at start
- Hallertauer 27.3g at start 
- Protofloc at 15mins 
- Hallertauer 11g at 10 min


1050 at 25 litres. Added an extra 5 litres, so will be about right hitting 1042 goal.

## Cool and ferment

Ferment at 14 degrees (lower end of range for more traditional lager character)

Mon 3rd (Day 8) took out of fridge at 14 into outside temps. Max 24?. 

Thu 6th (Day 14) was still bubbling
