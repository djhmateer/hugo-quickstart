Am doing 2 batches. 2nd batch figures are in brackets.

## Mash

- Lager malt - 4.65kg (4.46kg)
- Carahell malt - 0.12kg (0.22kg)

total grains: 

- Temp - 66
- Time - 45 mins with stirring at start (55 mins with stirring at end as it felt clumpy).. 

The bottom rubber seal is coming off when I'm stirring the grains in the mash. 2nd batch I put the seal in before putting into grainfather and did from bottom and was careful it wasn't twisted

## Boil

should be 1:15 boil (have done 1 hour)

- Northern Brewer 12g at start
- Hallertauer 21g at start 
- Protofloc at 15mins (did after cooling as had run out - thanks Andy)
- Hallertauer 8g at 10 min

about 1042 OG - which is perfect. At 23 litres. So will be 4.5%.

## Cool and ferment

SafLager W-34/70 yeast

Ferment at 13 degrees (lower end of range for more traditional lager character)

Am fermenting both batches at 14 degrees in fridge. Lows are 8 degrees at night, but with fermentation and in a garage, I'm thinking this will be fine without the heater plugged in.



Condition 4 weeks at 3 degrees
