## Live Yeast!

This was my first mistake not realising there was live yeast inside:

[I made a starter](/2022/02/03/yeast-starter/) to make sure the yeast was still good.

I didn't see the sticker

## Mash
Dingemans Pilsen Malt (3000 grams)
Crisp Flaked Maize (1500 grams)

Strike Water: 30.5 litres for a 22 litre batch size. This was a mistake (don't know why yet)

Strike temp: 66 degrees

Mash temp: hit 65 degrees

Length: 75mins

## Hoisting Brew Bag and Drain

Target Original Gravity: 1.046

## Fermenting

So I got 25 litres as opposed to 23 litres I was aiming for. Added 2 litres of starter yeast I've now got 27 litres of beer.

After adding my starter yeast, I've got an OG of: 1.035

[Increasing Alcohol Content](https://www.northernbrewer.com/blogs/brewing-techniques/increasing-alcohol-content-of-beer-kits) provides good background, essentially:

- Add DME
- Add sugars

[What to do if you miss OG](https://www.altitudebrew.com/blogs/news/what-to-do-if-you-miss-your-original-gravity-numbers#:~:text=Assuming%20a%205%20gallon%20batch,lbs%20of%20DME%20to%20add.) has some good tip, and I added 300g of DME, and 300g of sugar.

I didn't boil the DME - just added it. After some stirring of lumps (I will boil it next time to get rid of lumps and to dissolve the sugar) I got an OG of 1.042 which is much closer to the target of 1.046.

After a few days at around 12 degrees (max) fermentation has not started yet which is worrying.
