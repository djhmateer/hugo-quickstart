Strike Water: 30.5 litres for a 22 litre batch size

Strike temp: 66 degrees

Mash temp: hit 65 degrees

Length: 75mins

## Hoisting Brew Bag and Drain

Target Original Gravity: 1.046

## Fermenting

So I got 25 litres as opposed to 23 litres I was aiming for. Added 2 litres of starter yeast I've now got 27 litres of beer.

After adding my starter yeast, I've got an OG of: 1035

- add DME
- add sugars

I'm adding some DME to boost OG  gravity.

didn't boil the dme - just added.
FG was 1042 which is much better.
