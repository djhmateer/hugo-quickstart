I bought [Coopers Lager from the-home-brew-shop](https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/acatalog/Coopers_40_pint_Lager_Beer_Kit.html) who have excellent customer service.

This is my 2nd batch of home brew. The [first using Woodfordes Wherry](/2021/01/24/how-to-get-started-home-brewing-beer-woodfordes-wherry/) was a big success!

I was confused as to if I needed the flavour enhancer, and if not, did I need to add 1kg of sugar?

[jims beer kit forum](https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=33567#:~:text=You%20won't%20go%20wrong,pint%20out%20of%20that%20kit) suggests it is a good thing.

After steralising the fermentation bucket, I added the contents of the tin into a few litres of water. Then added in the flavour enhancer. I topped up the water to around 20l

It was foamy.

My cold water temperature had to be brought up to 21 with some hot water.

[![og](/images/2021-02-28/og.jpg "og")](/images/2021-02-28/og.jpg)

OG - Original Gravity should be approx 1038. It is difficult to read here, but seems about right. Next time I'll use the beaker to try and get more accurate.

FG - Final Gravity. Then we can use the forumla to calculate alcohol content.

> (OG â€“ FG) / 7.46 + 0.5 = approx. % Alcohol By Volume (ABV)

> 0.5 is added to allow for the extra alcohol produced through fermentation in the bottle. eg. (1036 - 1014) / 7.46 + 0.5 = 3.5% ABV 

## Brew

Recommended temperature is 21-27

After about 6 days at 21 (or 4 days at 27) it may be ready.

Test the SG each day. FG is reached once SG is stable 2 days in a row.

Recommend to taste and smell now.
