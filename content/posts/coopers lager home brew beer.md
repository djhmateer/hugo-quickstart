I bought [Coopers Lager from the-home-brew-shop](https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/acatalog/Coopers_40_pint_Lager_Beer_Kit.html) who have excellent customer service.

This is my 2nd batch of home brew. The [first using Woodfordes Wherry](/2021/01/24/how-to-get-started-home-brewing-beer-woodfordes-wherry/) was a big success!

## Mix 

[Instructions from Coopers](https://beer101.diybeer.com/instructions/international-series)

I was confused as to if I needed the flavour enhancer, and if not, did I need to add 1kg of sugar?

[jims beer kit forum](https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=33567#:~:text=You%20won't%20go%20wrong,pint%20out%20of%20that%20kit) suggests it is a good thing.

After steralising the fermentation bucket, I added the contents of the tin into a few litres of water. Then added in the flavour enhancer. I topped up the water to around 20l

It was foamy.

My cold water temperature had to be brought up to 21 with some hot water.

OG - Original Gravity should be approx 1038. It is difficult to read here, but seems about right. Next time I'll use the beaker to try and get more accurate.

FG - Final Gravity. Then we can use the forumla to calculate alcohol content.

> (OG â€“ FG) / 7.46 + 0.5 = approx. % Alcohol By Volume (ABV)

> 0.5 is added to allow for the extra alcohol produced through fermentation in the bottle. eg. (1036 - 1014) / 7.46 + 0.5 = 3.5% ABV 

## Stage 1 - Brew the Wort

Recommended temperature is 21-27

After about 6 days at 21 (or 4 days at 27) it may be ready.

Test the SG each day. FG is reached once SG is stable 2 days in a row.

Recommend to taste and smell now.

So it took longer - I transferred mine on the 9th day. It was probably fine on day 8, I just wanted to make sure the FG's were stable

[![fg](/images/2021-02-28/fg.jpg "fg")](/images/2021-02-28/fg.jpg)

FG should be around 1010, and I think this is around 1018. But is has been stable for 2-3 days so I'm fine with that. The temperature at night probably goes down to 15, so this may explain why it has taken longer to do the primary fermentation.

## Stage 2 - Secondary Ferment

As the instructions are about bottles, and I'm storing in a pressure vessel, I added 85g of dissolved sugar into the vessel.

I syphoned the beer into the barrel. Much better doing it outside where can spill it and don't have to clean up!

As nighttime temperatures are still low (down to 0) I'm keeping the beer inside for a few days.
