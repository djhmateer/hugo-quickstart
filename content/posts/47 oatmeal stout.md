Recipe from the Hughes book page 175.

Doing a half batch of 11.5 litres as an experiment.

[brewfather recipe](https://web.brewfather.app/tabs/recipes/recipe/BAfGoY68pGYPAWbW5mG0gJG6zO6O2A) trying it out so can see percentages of grains, IBUs and easily see additions.

## Water Profile

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre. so 2.3ml (this tallies with longman who did equivalent of 3.3ml)
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 2g per 10litres. so 2.1g (as longman went higher)

This is what longman used:

AMS - 33 g/ml
Calcium Chloride: 19 g/ml
Calcium Sulphate: 8 g/ml
Sodium Chloride: 17 g/ml

## Mash

67C Mash temp - got to temperature in about 30 minutes

- pale malt 2/1kg
- Rolled oats 250g
- Extra dark crystal malt 100g - sub for crystal malt
- Chocolate malt 80g
- Brown malt 35g - substitute for roasted barley

0650 Mash in

## Boil

Add sparge water at 0750

Boiling at 0810

- Admiral at start - 20g... should have been Challenger for IBU of 30 but this is IBU of 60!
- Admiral at end for 10mins hopstand - 8g 
- EKG at end for 10mins hopstand - 8g

Protofloc at 15mins

Hopstand at 0930

## Ferment

OG was 1048 at 20

I've got a Kveik, but want a traditional stout, so lets try it at 25 degrees which is the min to have less fruity flavours. [Voss Lalbrew](https://www.murphyandson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TDS_LPS_BREWINGYEAST_VOSS_ENG_A4.pdf). 5 to 7 days it says at this temp


## Clean



## TODO

- use brewfather to do brew day and help with process
- use bucket to lift water inside night before
- find other peoples water profiles around here
- measure mash liquor volume and sparge water




## Boil

Aiming for OG of 1040 ish at 30 litres output. Fill to the brim (careful over frothing)

- Bramling Cross 7% alpha acid (should have been Progress 6.2% - 34g ) - 31g (aa adjust) - start of boil
- Bramling Cross - 34g - 30 mins
- Fuggles - 18g - 0 mins
- EKG - 18g - 0 mins

Protofloc at 15 mins

Keep filling to brim

## Whirlpool / Hop stand

20 minutes

Then cool.

Came out at 1045 at 29 litres.   So I need 1 / 9 more water to get down to 1040. ie 3 litres more.

End of the boil - habe been topping up with sparge water. This gave me about 29 litres.

## Ferment

Day temps around 24 in the garage, and night around 10.

## Clean Up

Was nice to do a proper clean and the morning sun was good. Maybe start at 0500 next time.

Started at 0600 and finished at 1200.


## Next Time

Start earlier?

Double brew day?

Buy water additions

Do something with water so I don't have to lift it in the morning.

Do a full load of sparge water ie 15 litres or more?
