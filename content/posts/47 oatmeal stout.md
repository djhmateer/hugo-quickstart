Recipe from the Hughes book page 175.

Doing a half batch of 11.5 litres as an experiment.

[brewfather recipe](https://web.brewfather.app/tabs/recipes/recipe/BAfGoY68pGYPAWbW5mG0gJG6zO6O2A) trying it out so can see percentages of grains, IBUs and easily see additions.

## Water Profile

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre. so 2.3ml (this tallies with longman who did equivalent of 3.3ml)
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 2g per 10litres. so 2.1g (as longman went higher)

This is what longman used:

AMS - 33 g/ml
Calcium Chloride: 19 g/ml
Calcium Sulphate: 8 g/ml
Sodium Chloride: 17 g/ml

## Ferment

OG was 1048 at 20

I've got a Kveik, but want a traditional stout, so lets try it at 25 degrees which is the min to have less fruity flavours. [Voss Lalbrew](https://www.murphyandson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TDS_LPS_BREWINGYEAST_VOSS_ENG_A4.pdf). 5 to 7 days it says at this temp


## Clean

Use Sodium percarbonate based cleaners ie PBW

Was all done by 1050. Around 3.5 hours.



## TODO

- have a star san sanitisation tub to dip things in
- sanitise all kit before using
- use brewfather again to do brew day and help with process
- use bucket to lift water inside night before
- find other peoples water profiles around here
- measure mash liquor volume and sparge water
