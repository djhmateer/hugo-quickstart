Bought ingredients arrived on 30th April

65% Dingemans Pilsner malt (5kg)
13% Weyermann Munich (1kg)
7% Dark Candi Sugar (0.5kg)
5% Dingemans Special B (0.4kg)
4% Weyermann Caramunich (0.3kg)

Aimed for 1.090 OG, got 1.085 - forgot my efficiency would be lower for a big brew.
End up with 18 litres, and pitched a 2L starter of the WLP530.
