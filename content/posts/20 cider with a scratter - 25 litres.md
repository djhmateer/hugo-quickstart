The final very tasty product

4 big trays of apples gave us about 30 litres of apple juice. There was a bit consumed whilst pressing :-)

It was lovely doing this with a group of friends (and kids helping)

OG was 1048

I'm not adding any yeast and letting the natural yeast ferment this. Have got it at 18degrees (room temperature) and will see how long it takes to start fermenting.
