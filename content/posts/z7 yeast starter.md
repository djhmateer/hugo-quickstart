I had to make a yeast starter to make sure my yeast was still alive for [this brew](/2022/01/30/american-lager-brew-9/)

Here is the liquid yeast I'm working with:

## Good Instructions

These instructions were very clear.

19-24 C is okay

It took 3 days for my yeast to start. It is a low temperature lager yeast.
