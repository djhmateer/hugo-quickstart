## Good Instructions

[https://homebrewacademy.com/how-to-make-a-yeast-starter/](https://homebrewacademy.com/how-to-make-a-yeast-starter/)

Follow these rather than my instructions below.

19-24 C is okay

actually my yeast is 18-22

- 2litres + a bit more for boil off of water boiling in a pan (use a big pan!)

200g DME to boiling water (for 2 litres. Could use 100g for 1 litre)

Transfer wort to sanitised flask

Cool wort down to room temp with ice water?

Add liquid yeast to flask (mine has nutrients inside packet)

pop on bung or piece of foil

give it a stir as often as possible or use stir plate 

24 hours later yeast should be good to pitch into beer


- Do not use an air lock. As need oxygen to go in.

I guess I will know if my yeast is dead as nothing will happen.
