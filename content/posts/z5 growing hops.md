## Wild hops

[How to take hop cuttings](https://twothirstygardeners.co.uk/2016/05/how-to-take-hop-cuttings-note-its-easy/) are the instructions I followed.

After 7 days there is no action on the cuttings, and everything looks quite shriveled up.


## Buying a plant

- Hop plants are a hardy perennial, best planted as a bare root during the dormant winter months.
- Hops like a well drained fertile soil and should be planted in open ground as soon as possible.
- Make sure the hole is deep and the crown well covered.
- Mark the spot with a screw peg.
- Install your support (trellis, coir string) for the plant to climb up before the spring.
- Small shoots should appear when the weather warms (April)
- Train the shoots clockwise during May & June.
- Harvest at the end of August.

I hope this spot will work. Partially shaded. 19th April 2021. The frosts have just stopped.

Looking back on these instructions I don't think my hole was deep enough. Was probably about 30cm.


## 2021 harvest

17th sept harvested

70g with bag and hops

dried was probably 25g

## 2022 harvest

got 20g of dried hops

## 2023 harvest

26th September - a bit late as they were getting brown. Also not as much sun as previous years as garden getting overgrown.

## 2024 harvest

3rd of September. Been a strange year (quite wet and not massive periods of sunshine. Not above 30 either). But a big harvest with hops going really high.

354g wet weight of the hops. Wow. That is 5x the amount of year 1. Will dry them, then use fairly soon for a brew.
