Stephen squeezing 29Kg of Malt into the [Mash Tun](http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Mash_Tun). We left out some of the chocolate malt as it wouldn't fit until during the sparge

3 vessel system. Mash tun to the right, Hot Liquor Tank on top and Boil Kettle to the left.

Plate chiller in the centre. Amazing how fast it can cool 80 litres

1) Brewing water is heated in Hot Liquor Tank (HLT) - liquor is treated water
2) Mashing happens in Mash Lauter Tun (MLT) - we mashed for 1 hour
3) Wort is drained into Boil Kettle (BK) - we boiled for 1 hour

keeping everything sterile. We also used Iso propol alcohol in spray bottles to spray connectors. Apples are not allowed anywhere near the brewing process either.

Boil Kettle. Notice the missing butterfly nut on the bottom plate. Stepehen got it just in time, but maybe wasn't quite tight enough which caused the blockage later in the pump.

clearing the blockage in the pump - maybe hop leaf got into the Boil Kettle

 Yeast: [WHC Lab Saturated](https://whclab.com/product/dehydrated-saturated-dried-yeast-500g/)
  18-22 degrees

Very dark, and we ended up adding treated water to give us 1062 at about 80 litres

## Ferment

[![pot](/images/2022-10-08/13.jpg "fermenter")](/images/2022-10-08/13.jpg)

Left in a garage for 2 weeks so between 13 and 16 degrees. Probably not ideal.  22nd Oct 2022 

Notice no airlock, and have cracked the lid too.

FG was: 1023 - I think it is still fermenting. So am leaving another week at 18 degrees to see if it will finish. Smells and tasted really good.
