## Water Profile

- AMS (Acid Malt Solution) - 0.2ml per litre.  (this tallies with longman who did equivalent of 3.3ml) so 4ml for 20 litres
- DWB (Dry Water Builder) - 2g per 10litres. so 2.1g (as longman went higher). so 4g

## Recipe

This is inspired by my 49 smash recipe which was great. I'd like a bit more head

- Marris Otter 4.5kg (95.6%)
- Best Caramel pils 200g (4.4%)

-66 for 80 mins 
saccharification rest — a balance point where both beta-amylase (which works best ~60–65°C) and alpha-amylase (which works best ~68–72°C) are active, converting starches to sugars.

- 73 for 10 mins (hmmm )
- mashout at 78 for 10 mins

next day there was virtually no activity. The yeast I added was just in use by date, so I added another packet which has 2 more years left. I need this to ferment and condition for a party in 2.5 weeks.

New US-05 added on day 1.

## Notes 

Working on process - going very well to take my time!

I've got a lot of beer to make for parties!


Don't forget to put the filter under the big metal filter for the pump. It worked this time, but would like the extra filtration.

I've maxxed out the fermenter at 25 litres which may be a problem when fermentation kicks off and frothing happens. Will deal with it. I needed to do this as used extra grain to finish a bag and didn't want a strong beer.

Buy another fermenter (larger?) which I can do oxygenless transfers.

Sell my big burner. Maybe use it for sparge water to use up some gas?
