A team of us from [Lewes Home Brew](https://leweshomebrew.club/) met up at 0900 (finished about 1430) with the amazing Stephen Perrin, head brewer, from [Longman Brewery](https://www.longmanbrewery.com/) to do a brew on their 100 litre test kit.

SG of 1045 which is what we were aiming for. Notice the pale colour which is about right.

I went with Ekuanot and Mosaic for dry hopping

## Conclusion

Am amazing day learning about brewing by doing it. I'm quite excited about brewing this session beer, as it is a 'citrus' twist on the standard recipe. I'm also very excited about pushing the boundaries by experimenting with different styles of beer...next article!
