Morning around 0615 brewing during the summer - perfect!


Aiming for a 4% Harveys style / best bitter beer. The yeast I'm using is a [Lalbrew Nottingham high performance](https://www.lallemandbrewing.com/en/united-kingdom/products/nottingham-high-performance-ale-yeast/) which I'm going to push beyond the pitching rate of 0.5-1g/L. It is highly tolerant, and I' making low abv beer, so lets see. from 23 litres to 30 litres. Multiplication factor of 1.3.

Inspired by both these recipes

## Boil

Aiming for OG of 1040 ish at 30 litres output. Fill to the brim (careful over frothing)

- Bramling Cross 7% alpha acid (should have been Progress 6.2% - 34g ) - 31g (aa adjust) - start of boil
- Bramling Cross - 34g - 30 mins
- Fuggles - 18g - 0 mins
- EKG - 18g - 0 mins

Protofloc at 15 mins

Keep filling to brim

## Whirlpool / Hop stand

20 minutes

Then cool.

Came out at 1045 at 29 litres.   So I need 1 / 9 more water to get down to 1040. ie 3 litres more.

End of the boil

## Ferment

Day temps around 24 in the garage, and night around 10.


## Next Time

Buy water additions

Do something with water so I don't have to lift it.

Do a full load of sparge water ie 15 litres or more?
