After brewing for 2 years with a brew in a bag / pot / propane burner / no chiller / bucket ferment which is a great starter kit, I ended up buying 2nd hand

My friend found the post on the local [Brewzilla Facebook Group]() and I ended up buying everything from a great person who didn't have the time anymore to brew.

## What

Grainfather g30 with Bluetooth controller - £549 new

Bulldog hot water sparge tank  - £120 new

SS Brewtech fermenter - £225 new

A full fermentation chamber fridge with temperature controller and heater.  £150?

Hop spider, paddles, cleaners, and all the bits and bobs you'd need for a brew day. j

3 corny kegs as well.  - £150

## Why?

- Brewzilla will give me temp control through the mash (rather than old sleeping bag keeping the kettle warm)
- Fridge will allow temp control of fermentation
- Fridge will allow cooling of kegs for serving
