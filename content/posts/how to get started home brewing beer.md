## Kit

I found an excellent [YouTube Video - making beer from kits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfswLKBAwqY&feature=emb_imp_woyt) by the guys at [brewuk.co.uk](https://www.brewuk.co.uk/beerkits/beer/woodfordes-microbrewery.html). 

After not having a reply from an email I sent (Greg did reply promptly from their online chat thanks!) I ended up buying the same kit from [https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/](https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/) who did answer their emails with great customer service.

[Starter Kit: Woodfordes Wherry Microbrewery from the-home-brew-shop](https://www.the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/acatalog/Woodfords_Wherry_Starter_Kit.html) for £72 and 10 extra CO2 bottles for an extra £5.

It arrived after 4 or 5 days.

## Equipment

- Fermentation bucket
- Pressure barrel

After checking 

## Steralising

Ater reading 3 different methods this is what I did

- Add 10 litres of warm water (from my hot tap) to the fermentation bucket
- Add 5 teaspoons of steraliser
- Put spoon, airlock, and rubber grommit seal inside
- Put on lid
- Shake it up so the steraliser water gets everywhere
- Leave for 10 mins

The steraliser that comes with it is Sodium Metasilicate, which creates SO2, which kills of any bacteria.

## Stage 1 - Making the Wort

After warming the Hopped Malt Extract tins up for 5 mins in hot water from my tap

I opened them and poured both in and sloshed both out with hot water from a kettle

Then added cold water up to 5 gallons.

Stirred it all for 4 minutes and a foamy head appeared.

This now called [Wort](https://www.foodrepublic.com/2013/02/13/what-is-wort/)

## Specific gravity reading

I took a reading (although I read from the base of the liquid which I think is wrong). I didn't spin the hydrometer which would have got rid of the bubbles. It was around 1030 or 1035.

## Add Yeast

I then sprinked the yeast over the top (didn't stir)

Then put on the air lock, which isn't really necessary, but for me is exciting as I can see when it starts to bubble (also will tell me when fermentation is complete in around 7 to 10 days)

## Where to put the fermentation bucket

18-22 degrees is perfect. Not in the sun, nor close to any heat sources.

After 2 to 3 days we should see visisble signs of fermenting

After 7 - 10 days (more in hotter weather) the bubbling should stop, and SG should be 1040?

## Stage 2 - Pressure Barrel

- Steralise the barrel
- Add 85g of sugar
- Transfer the beer from the bucket to the barrel
- Leave for 2 days in a warm place (same as above ie 18-22) to further ferment
- Leave for 2-3 weeks somehwere coole (garage perhaps)

Then can drink using the tap from the pressure barrel. May have to add CO2 from the bulb as drink from the barrel to replenish CO2.
