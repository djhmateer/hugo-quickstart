Christmas is approachine so Rudolph is watching!


## Mash Out

Out temp: 77 degrees

Out time: 10 mins

After some research I've decided to skip this step and have left the mash in for 10 minutes longer.

## Hoisting Brew Bag and Drain

Target Original Gravity: 1.063

After letting the wort cool to ambient I got:  approx 1.060

Not sure how much wort in litres.

## Boil

This was an interesting afternoon

- 5 mins - ran out of gas
- left for 1 hour
- 10 mins - had to do family stuff
- left 1.5 hours

75 mins boil time

- 45 mins - 34g centennial
- 30 mins - 34g centennial

Leave to cool overnight

## Ferment

21st Nov 2021.

Temp of wort in the morning was 11 degrees.

Hit 19 litres (just with some siving)

24th nov (72 hours after putting in) it has finally started bubbling consistently. Apparently this is not unusual and the yeast can be a slow starter.

Day 7 - dry hop 100 g centennial

## Bottle / Condition

After just under 3 weeks I'm bottling for the first time

[https://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-priming-calculator/](https://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-priming-calculator/)

I'm going for 2.2 volumes of CO2, so 102g of sugar dissolved.
