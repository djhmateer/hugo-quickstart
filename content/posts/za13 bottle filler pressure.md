I'm using this to make fizzy water in an old water bottle. Like a soda stream.

Looks like commercially they fill to 40-55psi (check facts!), and the bottles are rated to around 100psi (ref). Standard coke bottles burst at 185psi.

Anyway I'm filling and leaving a good headroom at the top for the gas to around 50psi, which is producting good carbonation.

- 11psi for 1 week
- 45psi for 24 hours
- 50psi shake for 5 mins. repressuresixe shake for 5 mins. repeat 1 more time. remove from gas each time 30 mins
