After brewing for 2 years with a brew in a bag / pot / propane burner / no chiller / bucket ferment.. malt extract and all grain..

[https://craftalesociety.com/](https://craftalesociety.com/) - my friend Andy and I are showing our beers at the local craft ale society in a few months (25th Jan 2023) which is about 11 weeks.

There will be professional brewers there giving their opinion. So to mitigate embarrassment (and I've made lots of mistakes), I'm thinking strategically

## How do people judge beer

And it is theatre!

- Does it have a nice name?
- Label design good?
- Recipe sheet?

and more classically:

- taste
- smell
- clarity 
- head
- Is it fizzy enough
- Temperature - colder is generally better

## Strategy

Make something easy to get right.

- Higher ABV
- something I can practise doing so quicker feedback loop
- don't need much more kit (a challenge to keep it simple and cheap)


# Simple(s)

From the [Greg Hughes - Home Brew Beer book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Home-Brew-Beer-Greg-Hughes/dp/1409331768) the simplest recipes are:

- Strong Belgian (I like!)
- Bitter (crowd pleaser)
- Pale Ale (maybe go juicy ECIPA as thats what I like)

## YouTube - AIPA

Grain to glass in 10 days

[American IPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E7Ge3-Wu44&list=PLe0ZUhBOXP-dfa_p6HlNSoQcIbS2HCrUD) - citrus pineapple and spice. and lime


expecting 68% efficiency

higher temp.. more ester production

35c ferment

chest freezer.. brewers edge space headter,,, 

1 week ferment... was at 1023 the day after putting in. OG was 1060?

cold crash

serve in 10 days


## YouTube - Belgian Golden Strong

Single grain: Belgian Pilsner

Hops: Styrian Golding (at boil) and Sars (at 15)

Corn sugar at a few minutes to go (Dextrose)

## IPAs

IPA's have become very popular, especially Juicy ones. eg 

- [Only with Love - Juicy Pale Ale](https://onlywithlove.co/products/reboot-juicy-pale?variant=41809219485845) bestseller 4.5%.  Mango flavours.
- [Unbarred Joosy](https://www.unbarredbrewery.com/collections/unbarred-shop/products/joosy-5-1) Flagship. 5.1%. Amarillo and Simcoe. Also Oats and Wheat.
- [Abyss](https://abyssbrewing.co.uk/collections/cans/products/dank-marvin-juicey-ipa) Dank Marvin. 5.8%. Juicy IPA. Chinook, Columbus and Simcoe.
- [Beak](https://beakbrewery.com/collections/beer) most beers are IPA. Juicy.
- [Loud Shirt](https://loudshirtbeer.co.uk/product/hazed-confused-neipa-440ml-cans/) hazed and confused. 4.5% New England IPA (NEIPA). flagship

## Show Strategy

Take along Malt Extract ie how to get started. Take along brew kit. Take along books and photos. Take along a PDF of recipe sheets (so they can take away). Give people bottles of beer to take away with a nice label. Put costs on recipe sheets.

## Whats worked so far 

I've done 24 brews over the last few years with the highlights being

- Belgian West 12 clone - me -  9% - 5 months condition
- Double Hearted IPA clone - me - 7% - 7 months condition
- Sussex best in a barrel (most popular) - 4.5%

## Short Term - Ideas and Kit

Currently I've got a 50 litre pot using a Brew in a Bag system on a gas burner outside. Coo

- cleanliness
- temperature control (to avoid contamination, ferment at right speed)
- brew less so can do faster
- use corny kegs so more consistent and avoid contamination, and faster
- kveik yeast?

Use garage to condition as slightly cooler or side of house
