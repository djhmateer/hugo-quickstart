[https://craftalesociety.com/](https://craftalesociety.com/) - my friend Andy and I are showing our beers at the local craft ale society in a few months. There will be professional brewers there giving their opinion. So to mitigate embarrassment (and I've made lots of mistakes over the last 2 years), I'm thinking strategically


## How do people judge beer

- Does it taste good
- Does it smell good?
- How clear the beer is
- Is there a good head
- Is it fizzy enough
- Temperature - colder is generally better

## Strategy

Make something easy to get right

- Higher ABV
- something I can practise doing so quicker feedback loop

## Whats worked so far 

I've done 24 brews over the last few years.

## Ideas and Kit

Currenlty I've got a 50 litre pot using a Brew in a Bag system on a gas burner outside. Coo

- be vigilent on clenliness
- need a cooler so can avoid contamination
- brew less so can do faster
- use corny kegs so more consistent and avoid contamination, and faster
- kveik yeast?
- heat jacket / cooler for fermenter so consistency

Use garage to condition as slightly cooler or side of house
