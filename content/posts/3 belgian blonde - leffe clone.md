It comes with yeast.

This is the first time I've made beer from 'raw' ingredients.

It is the All Grain Mash brewing


And it is costing virtually the same so far.

So what came in the pack:

Dingemans Pilsen Malt (5000 grams)
Dingemans Aromatic Malt (227 grams)
Dingemans Pale Wheat Malt (227 grams)
Hallertauer Mittlefruh Pellets (83 grams)

## Grains

[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/) - produced from the finest European two row barley - £2.28 / Kg

[Malt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt) is germinated cereal grain that has been dried in a process known as "malting". The grain is made to germinate by soaking in water and is then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.

We have 5Kg in this pack

Chepeast barley is £28 for 25Kg sack. £30 for 25Kg sack which is £1.20/Kg

Confusion is whether I need to 'mash' this. As it has already been malted.

## Mashing

[https://byo.com/article/all-grain/](https://byo.com/article/all-grain/)

 converts the starch in the grains to germentable sugars through activation on enzymes by heat.

 Alpha amylase - best 67-75oC
 beta Amylase between 54-65oC


 mill (crush) the grain so husk breaks open, giving water access the ge grain starches and enzymes

 How water (also called hot liquor) is added to the masihng vessel, called a mash tun. So when mnised wiht the grain it is at a temperature that activates the enzymes.

 Next the crushed grain is added and mised such that there ar eno clumps of grian.

 Following this the mash is allowed to rest for an hour in order to gie the enzymes time to break apart the starches.


 A single infusion mashin is most common in home brewing, where one temp is employed between 62 to 72oC activating both enzymes to varying degrees.

 Following the mash rest, lautering beings. Lautering
