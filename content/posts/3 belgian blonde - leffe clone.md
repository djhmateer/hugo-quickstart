[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/belgian-blonde-leffe-clone/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/belgian-blonde-leffe-clone/) ordered for around £26 on 19th April.

It comes with yeast.

This is the first time I've made beer from 'raw' ingredients.

It is the All Grain Mash brewing - I'm using Brew in a Bag technique. The first 2 brews were Malt Extract style

So what came in the pack:

Dingemans Pilsen Malt (5000 grams)
Dingemans Aromatic Malt (227 grams)
Dingemans Pale Wheat Malt (227 grams)
Hallertauer Mittlefruh Pellets (83 grams)
Belgian Candi Sugar Rocks Clear 500g (1 packs)
Safbrew™ T-58 (1 packs) - yeast

## Mashing

grain + hot water + time = wort

boib - mash and boil in same vessel
 instead of using a dedicated mash ton with a false bottom or screen

## Lautering

separating grain (grist) from liquid wort

lautering (lifting)

## The Mash

5.5 gallons, to make 3.5 gallons after the boil
allowing for losses during boil
and absorbtion by the grain

23 litre batch size

[https://biabcalculator.com/](https://biabcalculator.com/)

So it looks like about 33litres may be a good starting amount of water (Strike Water). We're using no sparge method ie we wont add any other water.

heat water to about 70C (strike temperature). My mash temp is 66C 

when target temp is met, turn off the burner

slowly pour the grain into the bag, stir, break up any clumps

this mixture of grain and hot water is now called the mash

aim for mash temp of 66
if too cool, heat up slowly
if too hot, add cold water

when temp is good, cover the kettle and let the mash rest
 
rest mash for 90 minutes (my recipe) - enzymes now are breaking down complex starch into simple sugars that will be fermentable by brewers yeast

could stir a few times.. but not necessary

don't worry about temp drop

mash out (optional) .. after 60 minutes or 10 minutes before end..heat back up to 78C and stir. which will get higher specific gravity as more sugars will come out.


### Lautering

put bag out of kettle to let cool off (it will be hot)

transfer bag to a bucket... and any collected wort can be put back into the kettle

give bag a big squeeze.. (big gloves?)

Sparging - rinsing the grains after the mash

## The Boil

Boil
  take a gravity reading. 100ml sample. cool it, then hydrometer
or a few drops on a refratometer

bittering hops at 90minutes (to go).. longer the hops are in, the more bitter, and less flavour

add sugar at 10 minutes (to go!)

flavour and aroma hops (none)

0 minutes is flame out

finings - will help get clear wort

### Chilling the wort

use immersion chiller to cool from boiling to pitching temperature

or put in a bucket and leave to chill overnight




## First Unsuccessful try

[![pot](/images/2021-05-24/pot.jpg "pot")](/images/2021-05-24/pot.jpg)

This pot was too big for my gas burner. It heated up the electrical clicker which then shorted out tripping the breaker. So the time has come to brew outside.

## Grains

[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/) - produced from the finest European two row barley - £2.28 / Kg

[Malt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt) is germinated cereal grain that has been dried in a process known as "malting". The grain is made to germinate by soaking in water and is then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.

We have 5Kg in this pack

Chepeast barley is £28 for 25Kg sack. £30 for 25Kg sack which is £1.20/Kg

Confusion is whether I need to 'mash' this. As it has already been malted.

## Mashing

[https://byo.com/article/all-grain/](https://byo.com/article/all-grain/)

 converts the starch in the grains to germentable sugars through activation on enzymes by heat.

 Alpha amylase - best 67-75oC
 beta Amylase between 54-65oC


 mill (crush) the grain so husk breaks open, giving water access the ge grain starches and enzymes

 How water (also called hot liquor) is added to the masihng vessel, called a mash tun. So when mnised wiht the grain it is at a temperature that activates the enzymes.

 Next the crushed grain is added and mised such that there ar eno clumps of grian.

 Following this the mash is allowed to rest for an hour in order to gie the enzymes time to break apart the starches.


 A single infusion mashin is most common in home brewing, where one temp is employed between 62 to 72oC activating both enzymes to varying degrees.

 Following the mash rest, lautering beings. Lautering
