[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/belgian-blonde-leffe-clone/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/belgian-blonde-leffe-clone/) ordered for around £26 on 19th April.

It comes with yeast.

This is the first time I've made beer from 'raw' ingrediants. And it is costing virtually the same so far.

So what came in the pack:

[Dingemans Pilsen Malt (5000 grams)](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/)
Dingemans Aromatic Malt (227 grams)
Dingemans Pale Wheat Malt (227 grams)
Hallertauer Mittlefruh Pellets (83 grams)
Belgian Candi Sugar Rocks Clear 500g (1 packs)
Safbrew™ T-58 (1 packs)

## Grains

[https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/dingemans-pilsen-malt/) - produced from the finest European two row barley

[Malt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt) is germinated cereal grain that has been dried in a process known as "malting". The grain is made to germinate by soaking in water and is then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.
