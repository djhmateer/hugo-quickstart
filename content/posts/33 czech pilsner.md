<!-- [https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party. -->

Split brew day on Grainfather and BIAB 

<!-- [![pot](/images/2023-06-06/3.jpg "treatment")](/images/2023-06-06/3.jpg) -->

## Setup

28 litres of water in buckets heating up overnight inside. Went from 15 degrees to 19 degrees.

## Water treatment

No water treatment as am doing a split brew - want to check my water treatment before I do more. It is usually: 

- AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres (I added 20ml)
- DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash 

## Mash

- Pilsner Malt 4.66kg (I got 4.6kg so will see if I hit the OG)
- Temp - 65C 
- Time - 1 hour 

## Boil

- Saaz at start
- 1 Protafloc tablet (3g) at 15mins

1 hour boil

## Cool

got to around outside temp - 18 ish with the cooler

leaving other 12 litres to cool naturally in fermentation bucket, and pitch around this temp.

## Ferment 

OG was fine in BIAB at around 1046

OG was 1030 in the grainfather. - was aiming for 1046, so added 400g of sugar and this brought it up to 1040

Fermenting at 13 degrees.

FG was 1008 on 4th Aug. so 2.5 weeks fermenting

## Condition

At 3 degrees

## Drink

6 weeks later. It's still cloudy. But on 2nd Sept it is coming good. previous to that there was a fruity taste which I didn't like. Maybe just young beer.

In the fridge and not shaking up the keg is good way to serve.


## Next time

- do a rest at 72
