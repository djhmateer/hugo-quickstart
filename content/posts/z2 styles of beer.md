[List of beer styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_beer_styles)


There are a myriad of styles and nomenclature over the last 12,000 years of documented beer production.

[winemag](https://www.winemag.com/2020/09/03/most-popular-style-beer-guide/) provided a great overview which inspired a lot of below:

"Who defines beer styles like Pilsner, India pale ale and stout? The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) issues style guidelines for nearly 100 types of beer, mead and cider. Most brewers and homebrewers use these to sketch out recipes." 


All Beer falls into two styles

- Ales - yeast gathers towards the top. Aromatic and often fruity. Yeasts ferment between 15 and 24. Form a layer of foam on the surface. Ales age for a few weeks at 5-13 degrees

- Lagers (the most common beer style in the world) - yeasts that ferment around 10 collect at the bottom.. bottom-fermenting yeasts which ferment more slowly and at coolder temperatures. Usually: crisp, clean, refreshing. Lagers can age for months between 0 and 7 degrees.
