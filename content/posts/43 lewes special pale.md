With Richard (at his house) and Graham

Am trying out brewing software for this

[https://www.brewersfriend.com/](https://www.brewersfriend.com/) would be the alternative.

## Water treat

evening before

30 litres of water warming up (and getting rid of chlorine)

water treatments (to get to a neutral burton..perfect for crips pale beers)


## Mash

Difference to my normal brew was Richard did 12 litres to get a porridge like consistency. 

He didn't use a lid, nor the top filter plate when running the wort through

1 hour at 66

5 mins at 75 mash out

## Sparge

Added warm water to sparge up to 24.8 ? litres

## Boil

1 hour
