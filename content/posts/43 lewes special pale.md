With Richard (at his house) and Graham

Am trying out brewing software for this

## Water treat

evening before

30 litres of water warming up (and getting rid of chlorine)

water treatments (to get to a neutral burton..perfect for crips pale beers)


## Mash

Difference to my normal brew was Richard did 12 litres to get a porridge like consistency. 

He didn't use a lid, nor the top filter plate when running the wort through

1 hour at 66

5 mins at 75 mash out

## Sparge

Added warm water to sparge up to 24.8 ? litres

## Boil

1 hour

## Ferment

In fermenter on Tue 27th Feb with OG of 1048

Thu 29th am was 1040 (slow to start)

On Sun 3rd March (Day 5) it is 1016. Raising temp from 19 to 21 and aiming for FG of 1011.
