> The key to producing great beer is to pay proper attention to sanitation (Hughes Book)

I've got 5 kegs now.. but have had 2 batches go 'bad' with probably infections. Sort of an unwanted fruity taste after maybe a month in keg.

So lets deep clean the kegs then, and be more vigilant in the brewing process. Professional brewers are meticulous.

- Sodium percarbonate based cleaners - eg PBW (use for cleaning)
- Phosphoric acid based sanitisers - eg Star San / Chem San (use for sanitising anything wort touches after boil)
- Make stainless stell shiny
- Chlorine based cleaner sanitisers - eg VWP (used to use this)

## Cleaning

Almost all are sodium percarbonate based

- PBW - powdered brewery wash (not caustic)
- chemclean
- Oxyclean
- Malt Miller own one 

do not use on wood - it turns them black (his kitchen worktops!)

its an alkai solution

removing dirt, grime etc.. from equipment

don't use soaps as they have oils and fragances which sometimes stick around

28g per 3.8 litres

over 40 degrees is best

soak from a few minutes to overnight

it does need rinsing


## Clean Keg Process and Brew System

heat 22 litres to 65 degrees? in brew system

take apart
 take all bits apart

circulate with pump

fill bowl with bits with solution

fill keg with pbw solution

turn long dip tube upside down.. then move gaskets

let is soak

turn upside down (After putting on top) to let it soak

soak for 15-30mins (or overnight is fine)


## Sanitising Kit

Anything that comes into contact with the wort after the boil needs to be sanitised

Removing most of the microbes eg bacterias and yeasts

Steralising is removing all microbial life
  
- chiller
- fermenter
- tubing
- kegs


## Sanitiser

eg Star San (US?)) / Chem San (UK)

A blend of phosphoric acid and benzenesulfonic acid and isopropanol.

but needs water of < 3.5 pH

10ml to 5 litres of water. 
most have 1.5ml per litre

contatct time is 30secs

designed to foam 


## VWP
been around for years
chlorine based powder
cleans and sanitises in 1 go
needs thoroughly rinsing

stainless steel advise against chlorine based products on their kit

not recommended anymore

## Sodium Metabisulphate

aka campden tablet (more commonly used in winemaking) not recommended for sanitisng.

## Soaps 

dont use as may leave fragrances.. and unsuitable for getting rid of proteins and may leave scale.

## Dishwashers

avoid using cleaners (soap).. useful for glass

most homebrewers only use this for glass bottle cleaning
