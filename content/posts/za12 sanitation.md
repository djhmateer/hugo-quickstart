I've got 5 kegs now.. but have had 2 batches go 'bad' with probably infections. Sort of an unwanted fruity taste after maybe a month in keg.

So lets deep clean the kegs then, and be more vigilant in the brewing process. Professional brewers are meticulous.


types of sanitisors

## Acid Based

eg Star San

but needs water of < 3.5 pH


## Sodium Metabisulphate

aka campden tablet.

not recommended for steralisation.
