[https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw](https://share.brewfather.app/36b9wFHyxgBxgw) similar recipe that I am making. I'm going for 3.8% as it is hot weather and the beer is for a party.

## Setup

20 litres of water in Grainfather heating up overnight inside. Went from 15 degrees to 19 degrees.

0805 put on water. Came up to temp in about 35 mins.


## Water treatment
AMS (CRS) / Lactic acid: 24ml for 20 litres (I added 20ml)
DWB: 10g for 20 litres in the mash 

## Mash

- Extra Pale Malt 4.3kg
- Light crystal malt 95g

Temp - 65C 
Time - 1 hour 

Mash in at 0855. Forgot to turn on the pump, so turned on at 0950 for 15 mins.

## Sparge

1015 started and put temp up to 100

Added 9 litres to get to 27 litres of liquor in total. Aiming for 23 litres after the boil

## Boil

Boil started at 1050 (this step always takes time 35 mins even though I added boiling water on the sparge)

## Cool

I leave in my armona hops until all cooled and in the fermenter. [chat here](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/question-on-adding-hops-at-end-of-boil.481514/)

got it to 39 degrees

Pitching at 35degrees and aiming to get to 40 (optimal)

fridge starting temp 27.6 degrees. Set heater to 38 degrees

Fermented out in 2.5 days!

Cold crash down to 5 degrees and added CO2 


## Condition and Drink

[![pot](/images/2023-06-06/2.jpg "treatment")](/images/2023-06-06/2.jpg)

Was drinking this tasty beer in 5 days

After 3 weeks it changed a lot .. conditioning has helped!

This is a delicious beer. The additional hops are good and the additional strength too. I'll probably dial it down a bit next time to make more sessionalble, but keep the hop content up.
