Page 84 from Greg Hughes Home Brew Beer book.

Aiming for about 25 litres (compared to 23 litres in book)

5.5% ABV

## Mash

- Lager malt - 5 kg
- Flaked Rice - 1kg

total grains: 

- Temp - 65
- Time - should be 75 mins 

Started at 0800 ended at 1020. Forgot to put on a seal so had to sparge in-situ as grain basket fell apart.

"Your mash should be of a poddidge like consistency"

Think I put in too much water which caused grains to go over the top and recirc. Also did a lot of stirring to try and improve effeciency.

## Boil

- Norther Brewer 25g at start
- Protofloc at 15 mins
- Saaz 13g at 1 min to go

Boiled about 50 mins.

## Cool and ferment

OG is 1052 which is about perfect (aiming for 1055) with x litres
 (aiming for 25)

Ferment at 12 degrees

Condition 4 wweeks at 3 degrees

2 weeks and 2 days it is still fermenting


## Keg

12th Dec - I think this is the smaller amount one.. look for flaked rice in trub.
