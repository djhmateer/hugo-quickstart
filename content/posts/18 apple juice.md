[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-to-make-cider](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-to-make-cider) Using this recipe I picked some apples then:

- washed them
- cut them in half

- put a bit of water in to get the blender started

- used some [straining cloth](https://www.amazon.co.uk/straining-cloth/s?k=straining+cloth) and squeezed with my hands

It is amazing how easy it is to make very good apple juice. Our tree is more of a cooking apple tree, but even so, the juice was very drinkable.
