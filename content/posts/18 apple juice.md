[https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-to-make-cider](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-to-make-cider) Using this recipe I picked some apples then:

- washed them
- cut them in half

- put a bit of water in to get the blender started

- used some [straining cloth](https://www.amazon.co.uk/straining-cloth/s?k=straining+cloth) and squeezed with my hands

It is amazing how easy it is to make very good apple juice. Our tree is more of a cooking apple tree, but even so, the juice was very drinkable.

## Cider

1/4 teaspoon of sodium metabisulphate - to hopefully stop any off flavour yeast cultures.

EC-1118 yeast which should be fermented [low and slow](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/lager-yeast-for-cider.378008/) hmmm which could be a problem as it is hot here. 35 degrees day time. 24 average coming up. Maybe will ferment outside.

## 12 days later

No fermentation is happening! Perhaps hot temperatures, too much sodium metabisulphate in the original 4 litres.

So I'm adding more EC-1118 yeast now that I've got 20 litres.
